    # Use the latest available GitHub-hosted Ubuntu Linux runner.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:

      # Step 1: Download the repository content into the runnerâ€™s workspace
      # so later steps can access the source code using the checkout action.
      - name: Repository checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Set up a specific Python runtime on the runner using the setup-python action.
      - name: Install Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
      # Request Python 3.11 to ensure a consistent environment.
          python-version: '3.11'

      # Step 3: Upgrade pip to its latest version to avoid
      # known bugs or incompatibilities. Install all project dependencies listed
      # in requirements.txt so the code and tests can run.
      # Explicitly install pytest, the test runner,
      # guaranteeing it is available even if not listed in requirements.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install pytest

      # Step 4: Change directory to src where the test files reside,
      # ensuring pytest runs from the correct project root. Discover and execute all unit tests, 
      # producing a non-zero exit code if any test fails, which will cause the job (and workflow) to fail.
